# Adaptive-Peak-Shaver
Unlike conventional means of shaving electricity peaks, the presented method adaptively detects the feasible caps to shave, regarding the capacity of battery enery storage system (BESS) to charge / discharge. The developed BESS algorithm is responsible to manage the Power dispatch strategy to help the residential power supply and green hydrogen production.



The required inputs of the system are the total expected renewable energy generation (Solar + Wind + Hydro, ....) (MW) and the overall electricity (MW) demand alongside the power capacity of the used battery (MWh). The algorithm does the rest.
